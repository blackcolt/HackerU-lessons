Hi good to see you here, glad you made it.

For cloning this repo you need to install git client on your mechine

## Windows
Go to this URL and download git client.
https://git-scm.com/download/win

## mac:
There are several ways to install Git on a Mac. The easiest is probably to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. On Mavericks (10.9) or above you can do this simply by trying to run git from the Terminal the very first time.

Done.
