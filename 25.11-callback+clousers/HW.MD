#API HOMEWORK#
1.
- Open a weather account https://openweathermap.org/api (Don't worry its free)
- Create a key in your account.
- Create a page that display the current weather in some area. ($.getJson)
- Add a list (select in html) of area that with a display name and value.
- Each time the user change the selected value we make a new request to the API and displaying the new weather

Dispaly all the data that you think is informativ for the user.
Design it a bit, make it look good.
**Upload this project to github and SEND IT**

2. go to this API docs and try to get bitcoin currency https://docs.coinapi.io/
**Bonus point - If you can use authorization header**

#CallBack HOMEWORK#
Provide a callback function to the "getJSON function (the wrpper function) that get the data from the getJSON response and and add it to the html (please refer to the lesson recording).

IN a diffrent JS file, create two function (one that console.log "something", and the other take a function as a **param** and call it.(cb))
Call this function once with a function as a param, and once without any params. (it will cause an error - make it work).

Good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor.

#Networking HOMEWORK#
 - Find a site that redirect you to another place and print screen (like I showd you in Ynet) 
(You can check it in the network tab and check for status code 3XX)
 - Find a 404 page (be creativ) and print screen
