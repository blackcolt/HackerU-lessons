## SQL Injection attack

When the user gives an input which changes the original query

- Try in sign in: ' OR '1' = '1' '
- Try (with caution!!): ' OR '1' = '1' '; DROP DATABASE icar;
- Try (with caution!!): '' OR '1' = '1' '; DUMP DATABASE icar;


## XSS - Cross Site Scripting attack
user can input some script or html data which will change they our page work as originally designed

`<script>window.location="http://google.com"</script>`

When printing a string which originates from the user use one of the following functions:

- htmlentities
- htmlspecialchars
- filter_input

## CSRF - Cross Site Request Forgery attack

The hacker convinces you to click on a link which will send a form to a website

### conditions for attack to work

- The victim has to be logged in
- The form can be all field with out hidden variables

### Solutions

- when you finish with a website LOGOUT!!
- logout the user automatically after some period of time
- if the request is suspicious or sensitive perform another validation process (SMS, password...)
- add psudo-code with each request that only the server knows
- check the referrer header

## Password Hashing 

It is bad practice to save the password as is in the DB.

The password should be saved without any possibility even for the programmer to know what the user typed in. for that reason we will hash the password on signup and from now on on every login we will check does the hashing match.

- for hashing use: `$passwordHashed = password_hash('password', PASSWORD_BCRYPT);`
- for validation use: `password_verify('password', $passwordHashed)`
